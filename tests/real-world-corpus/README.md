# Real-world artifact corpus

This opt-in corpus complements Hexlora's deterministic synthetic and hostile-input fixtures with
real, publicly distributed software artifacts. It is intentionally not checked into Git and is not
part of the ordinary pull-request quality gate.

Each manifest entry is pinned to an immutable release or source commit and records its exact byte
length, SHA-256 digest, upstream project, declared license, and stable report assertions. The fetch
script rejects a payload before analysis if either its size or digest differs. Hexlora only reads
these artifacts; the workflow never executes, installs, mounts, or launches them.

Fixed ZIP or tar.gz distributions may be prepared into an isolated directory when the artifact under
test is the contained macOS `.app`. Preparation happens only after size and digest verification and
rejects absolute paths, parent traversal, and ZIP backslash paths before extraction. It exists solely
to present the real bundle to Hexlora; the application is never launched.

Run the corpus locally:

```sh
scripts/fetch-real-world-corpus.sh
scripts/test-real-world-corpus.sh
```

Downloaded artifacts and generated reports live under `target/real-world-corpus/`. GitHub Actions
runs the same scripts on a weekly schedule and through manual dispatch, with the downloads cached by
the manifest hash. A download failure is reported separately from a Hexlora assertion failure.

## Coverage model

One real package can exercise several layers. The APK covers ZIP, binary AndroidManifest, DEX and
Android semantics; the IPA covers ZIP members, plists, Mach-O targets, privacy and signing metadata;
the DEB covers ar, tar, control metadata, payload modes and Linux package semantics. Dedicated PE,
ELF, macOS `.app`, DMG, signed/notarized PKG/XAR, ISO 9660, MSIX and identification-only RPM samples
preserve the public support-level boundaries. The macOS app corpus includes valid Developer ID,
notarized, and invalid-signature cases. It asserts the platform trust tools, Hexlora's signature
state, and the appropriate absence or presence of high-severity signature findings.

Microsoft's official APPX negative fixtures add untrusted-certificate, tampered signed-block-map, and
invalid code-integrity scenarios. They currently prove safe parsing, identity recovery, signature and
block-map presence, and embedded executable findings. Hexlora does not yet perform Windows trust
chain or `AppxSignature.p7x` cryptographic verification on macOS, so the manifest records those source
scenarios without claiming that their trust failure is detected. This is an explicit capability gap,
not a passing security verdict.

Synthetic fixtures remain authoritative for malformed offsets, traversal, symlinks, CRC damage,
decompression limits, cancellation and deterministic edge cases. Real artifacts are regression and
compatibility evidence, not a replacement for adversarial unit tests.

When adding or updating a sample:

1. Use an open-source project and a permanent version/tag or commit URL.
2. Record the repository license without copying the artifact into this repository.
3. Download it to a temporary directory and independently calculate byte length and SHA-256.
4. Add semantic assertions that describe stable product behavior, not incidental UUIDs or timestamps.
5. Run the complete corpus locally before committing the manifest.
