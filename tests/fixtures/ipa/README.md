# Shared IPA compatibility fixtures

These fixtures are synthetic and contain no third-party application code. `ipaview-contract.json`
records the stable JSON keys and rule behavior from IPAView's `IPAAuditCore`. Both IPAView and
Hexlora can consume this language-neutral contract when validating compatibility.

The executable fixtures are generated deterministically in tests from minimal Mach-O headers so
the suite covers thin arm64 and fat arm64+x86_64 without checking binary applications into Git.
The compatibility matrix creates 20 legally owned synthetic IPA variants and audits each twice,
covering missing versions and executables, simulator slices, privacy manifests, weak usage text,
and extensions while asserting deterministic IPAView-compatible JSON.
